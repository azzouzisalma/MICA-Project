# MICA-Project (Matlab interface for a cardiac analyst)
Signal-processing

The heart’s electrical system controls all the events that occur when the heart pumps blood. A
heartbeat is a complex cycle of electrical conductive events. These events take place inside and around
the heart. A heartbeat is a single cycle in which the heart’s chambers relax and contract to pump
blood. This cycle includes the opening and closing of the inlet and outlet valves of the right and left
ventricles of the heart. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that detects and records the strength
and timing of cardiac electrical activity. The main goals of our project are :
  — Visualizing electrocardiogram (ECG) and analyzing the spectrogram obtained.
  — Using Pan and Tompkins algorithm to detect the QRS complexes
  — Deducing the position of P and T waves
  — Using algorithms to detect cardiac pathologies automatically
